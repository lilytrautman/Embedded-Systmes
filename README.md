# Embedded-Systmes
Embeded/Arduino projects
Basic Arduino Examples: Programmed various programs that run through an Arduino board. Used different peripherals including servo motors, LEDs, and buttons, and explored serial input and output
Embedded Security System: Worked in a group to create an embedded security system. My role was the programming of a tilt sensor that would react to JSON commands and act as a lock in a final, integrated system
Embedded systems class project: a security system that monitors a scanning sensor and drives a lock actuator. I built the tilt module and the actuator integration.
